# Java OOP Vehicles
A simple object-oriented Java project demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and interface usage with various vehicle types.

## Overview

This project models different types of vehicles (e.g. cars, motorcycles, ships) and their specific behaviors using OOP principles. It's designed as an educational example to illustrate:

- Class inheritance
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism in action

## Classes

- `Start` – Main class to run the demo
- `MotorFahrzeug` – Abstract base class for motorized vehicles
- `Auto`, `Motorrad`, `Cabrio`, `Coupe` – Specialized vehicle types
- `Schiff`, `Amphibium` – Vehicles with water capability
- `IstSchwimmfaehig` – Interface for swim-capable objects

## How to Run
